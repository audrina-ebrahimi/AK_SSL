## üìç Overview
Welcome to the Self-Supervised Learning Library! This repository hosts a collection of tools and implementations for self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning is a powerful paradigm that leverages unlabeled data to pre-trained models, which can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks with smaller labeled datasets. This library aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive set of tools to experiment, learn, and apply self-supervised learning techniques effectively.
This project was our assignment during the summer apprenticeship and final project in the newly established Intelligent and Learning System ([ILS](http://ils.ui.ac.ir/)) laboratory at the University of Isfahan.

## üîé Supported Methods

### [BarlowTwins](./AK_SSL/models/barlowtwins.py)
Barlow Twins is a self-supervised learning method that aims to learn embeddings invariant to distortions of the input sample. It achieves this by applying two distinct sets of augmentations to the same input sample, resulting in two distorted views of the same image. The objective function measures the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with these distorted sample versions, striving to make it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the embedding vectors of the distorted sample versions to become similar while minimizing redundancy among the components of these vectors. Barlow Twins particularly benefits from utilizing high-dimensional output vectors.

### [BYOL](./AK_SSL/models/byol.py)
BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) is one of the new approaches to self-supervised learning. Like other methods, BYOL aims to learn a representation that can be utilized for downstream tasks. It employs two neural networks for learning: the online and target networks. The online network is trained to predict the target network's representation of the same image from a different augmented view. Simultaneously, the target network is updated with a slow-moving average of the online network's parameters. While state-of-the-art methods rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. It directly minimizes the similarity between the representations of the same image from different augmented views (positive pair).

### [MoCos](./AK_SSL/models/moco.py)
MoCo, short for Momentum Contrast, is a self-supervised learning algorithm that employs a contrastive loss. MoCo v2 represents an enhanced iteration of the original Momentum Contrast self-supervised learning algorithm. Motivated by the findings outlined in the SimCLR paper, the authors introduced several modifications in MoCo v1, which included replacing the 1-layer fully connected layer with a 2-layer MLP head featuring ReLU activation for the unsupervised training stage. Additionally, they incorporated blur augmentation and adopted a cosine learning rate schedule. These adjustments enabled MoCo to outperform the state-of-the-art SimCLR, even when utilizing a smaller batch size and fewer epochs.

MoCo v3, introduced in the paper "An Empirical Study of Training Self-Supervised Vision Transformers," represents another advancement in self-supervised learning. It builds upon the foundation of MoCo v1 / MoCo v2 and addresses the instability issue observed when employing ViT for self-supervised learning.

In contrast to MoCo v2, MoCo v3 adopts a different approach where the keys naturally coexist within the same batch. The memory queue (memory bank) is discarded, resulting in a setting similar to that of SimCLR. The encoder fq comprises a backbone (e.g., ResNet, ViT), a projection head, and an additional prediction head.

### [SimCLRs](./AK_SSL/models/simclr.py)
SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Representations) is a self-supervised technique used to learn image representations. The fundamental building blocks of contrastive self-supervised methods, such as SimCLR, are image transformations. Each image is transformed into multiple new images through randomly applied augmentations. The goal of the self-supervised model is to identify images that originate from the same original source among a set of negative examples. SimCLR operates on the principle of maximizing the similarity between positive pairs of augmented images while minimizing the similarity with negative pairs. The training process can be summarized as follows: Data Augmentation - SimCLR employs robust data augmentation techniques to generate multiple augmented versions of each input image.

### [SwAV](./AK_SSL/models/swav.py)
SwAV, or Swapping Assignments Between Views, is a self-supervised learning approach that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, it simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, SwAV uses a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view.

### [CLIP](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/clip.py)
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a deep learning method that jointly trains images and text. This model consists of two neural networks: an image encoder and a text encoder. The image encoder takes an image as input and produces a vector of numbers as output, representing the content of the image. The text encoder takes a sentence as input and produces a vector of numbers as output, representing the meaning of the sentence. The goal of CLIP is to learn to make the output vectors of the image encoder and the text encoder similar for related images and sentences. For example, if an image of a cat and a sentence like "This is a cat" are given to CLIP, the model should produce similar output vectors for the image and the sentence. CLIP is trained using a technique called contrastive learning. In contrastive learning, the model is given a set of images and sentences and is asked to pair the related images and sentences together. The model learns by optimizing a loss function that measures the difference between the output vectors for related images and sentences.

### [ALBEF](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/albef.py)
ALBEF (ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing) is a deep learning method used to improve the accuracy of image and language processing tasks. This method is based on the idea of precisely aligning features extracted from different inputs before merging them into a single representation. ALBEF works by first extracting features from image and text inputs separately. This can be done using various deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks for images or recurrent neural networks for text. Next, ALBEF aligns the extracted features in a shared space. This alignment ensures that features related to similar concepts are positioned in similar locations in the representation space. Various methods can be used for feature alignment, such as:

- Attention-based alignment: This method uses an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of each input and then aligns the corresponding features in a shared space.
- Metric-based alignment: This method uses a similarity metric to measure the similarity between features from different inputs and then aligns them in a shared space based on this similarity.
  
After aligning the features, ALBEF merges them into a single representation. This merging can be done in various ways, such as:

- Sum integration: This method sums the aligned features.
- Neural network-based integration: This method uses a neural network to learn how to merge the aligned features in a non-linear way.

Finally, ALBEF uses the merged single representation to make a prediction or decision. This prediction can be related to a classification, categorization, or question-answering task.

### [SLIP](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/slip.py)
SLIP (Self-supervision meets Language-Image Pre-training) is an innovative method in machine learning within the realm of deep learning that offers a powerful combination of self-supervision and language-image pre-training. This approach allows models to simultaneously learn from large paired datasets of images and text. The main idea behind SLIP is to use self-supervision, utilizing the inherent signals in the data to create artificial labels instead of relying on expensive manual labeling. For example, the title of an image can serve as a label for that image. Additionally, with language-image pre-training, SLIP enables the model to understand the relationships between visual and linguistic concepts. This helps the model perform more complex tasks, such as generating image descriptions, answering questions about images, and even creating new images based on textual descriptions.
Using the SLIP method offers numerous advantages, including efficient data utilization, improved performance on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, text generation, and image-to-text translation, as well as a deeper understanding of the connections between language and images. These features make SLIP highly useful and effective for many real-world applications.

### [VSE](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/vse.py)
VSE (Visual-Semantic Embedding) is a powerful method in machine learning used to establish a connection between visual and textual information. The main goal of VSE is to map images and text into a shared vector space such that images related to similar texts are close to each other. VSE helps models understand the complex relationship between visual and linguistic concepts, which is crucial for many real-world applications. VSE is utilized in a wide range of applications, including text-based image retrieval, image description generation, answering questions about images, and multi-modal recommendation systems. Additionally, VSE serves as the foundation for many advanced multi-modal models capable of processing and understanding various types of data, such as images, text, audio, and video.
VSE works by first converting images and texts into dense vectors. For images, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract visual features. For text, natural language models like BERT or GPT are used to generate word vectors. These vectors are then mapped into a shared vector space designed to bring related images and texts close together. A similarity function, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, is used to measure the similarity between images and texts.

### [SimVLM](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/simvlm.py)
SimVLM (Simple Visual Language Model Pretraining with Weak Supervision) is a powerful pre-training method in machine learning that allows models to simultaneously learn from large paired datasets of images and text. This method is based on the idea of using weak supervision, which utilizes the inherent signals in the data to create artificial labels instead of requiring expensive manual labeling. As mentioned, the main idea behind SimVLM is the use of weak supervision. SimVLM uses weak signals such as image titles, product descriptions, or auto-generated captions produced by text generation models. These weak signals act as artificial labels for training the model. By using image-text pairs, SimVLM enables the model to understand the relationship between visual and linguistic concepts. This helps the model perform more complex tasks, such as generating image descriptions, answering questions about images, and even creating new images based on textual descriptions.

### [UNITER](./AK_SSL/multimodal/models/uniter.py)
UNITER (UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning) is an advanced model in the field of deep learning designed for learning unified representations of images and text. This model is developed to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between visual and linguistic concepts and to improve performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. UNITER maps images and text into shared vector spaces using a dual-branch transformer. This space is designed so that related images and texts are close to each other. It also utilizes weak supervision, such as image titles, product descriptions, or auto-generated captions produced by text generation models. These weak signals act as artificial labels for training the model. UNITER uses a multi-head attention mechanism to simultaneously focus on different parts of the image and text, modeling the relationships between them. Compared to other multimodal pre-training methods, UNITER performs better on complex tasks due to its use of a dual-branch transformer and multi-head attention.

  trainer.train(               
      batch_size=256,          # the number of training examples used in each iteration as integer

```


### Evaluating th Self-Supervised Model
This evaluation assesses how well the pre-trained model performs on a dataset, specifically for tasks related to linear evaluation.
```python
trainer.evaluate(
    train_dataset=train_dataset,      # to specify the training dataset as torch.utils.data.Dataset
    test_dataset=test_dataset,        # to specify the testing dataset as torch.utils.data.Dataset
    eval_method="linear",             # the evaluation method to use as string (linear or finetune)
    top_k=1,                          # the number of top-k predictions to consider during evaluation as integer
    epochs=100,                       # the number of evaluation epochs as integer
    optimizer='Adam',                 # the optimization algorithm used during evaluation as string (Adam, SGD, or AdamW)
    weight_decay=1e-6,                # a regularization term applied during evaluation to prevent overfitting as float
    learning_rate=1e-3,               # the learning rate for the optimizer during evaluation as float
    batch_size=256,                   # the batch size used for evaluation in integer
    fine_tuning_data_proportion=1,    # the proportion of training data to use during evalutation as float in range of (0.0, 1]
)
```

### Get the Self-Supervised Model backbone

In case you want to use the pre-trained network in your own downstream task, you need to define a downstream task model. This model should include the self-supervised model backbone as one of its components. Here's an example of how to define a simple downstream model class:

```python
  class DownstreamNet(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, backbone, **kwargs):
          super().__init__()
          self.backbone = backbone
  
          # You can define your downstream task model here
  
      def forward(self, x):
          x = self.backbone(x)
          # ...
  
  
  downstream_model = DownstreamNet(trainer.get_backbone())
```

### Loading Self-Supervised Model Checkpoint

To load a previous checkpoint into the network, you can do as below.
```python
path = 'YOUR CHECKPOINT PATH'
trainer.load_checkpoint(path)
```

### Saving Self-Supervised Model backbone
To save model backbone, you can do as below.

```python
trainer.save_backbone()
```


That's it! You've successfully trained and evaluate a self-supervised model using the AK_SSL Python library. You can further customize and experiment with different self-supervised methods, backbones, and hyperparameters to suit your specific tasks.
You can find the description of Trainer class and its function using `help` built in fuction in python.
