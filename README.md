## 📍 Overview
Welcome to the Self-Supervised Learning Library! This repository hosts a collection of tools and implementations for self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning is a powerful paradigm that leverages unlabeled data to pre-train models, which can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks with smaller labeled datasets. This library aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive set of tools to experiment, learn, and apply self-supervised learning techniques effectively.
This project was our assignment during the summer apprenticeship in the newly established Intelligent and Learning System laboratory at the University of Isfahan.

## ✍️ Self Supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are trained to predict certain aspects of the input data without relying on manual labeling. This approach has gained significant attention due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, which is often easier to obtain than fully annotated datasets. This library provides implementations of various self-supervised techniques, allowing you to experiment with and apply these methods in your own projects.
